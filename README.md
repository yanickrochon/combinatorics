# Combinations and Permutations

Provides functions to easily calculate combinations and permutations.


## Permutations

*When order matters.*


## Combinations

*When order does not matter.*

The Combinations Calculator will find the number of possible combinations
that can be obtained by taking a sample of items from a larger set.
Basically, it shows how many different possible subsets can be made from
the larger set.


## Usage

```js
import combination from 'combinatorics';

console.log( combination(4, 2) );  // 6
```
